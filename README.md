# vCard Platform API (PHP Integration)

## Overview
The vCard Platform API enables interaction with the vCard system, allowing you to perform operations such as creating vCards, making transactions, and managing card information. This guide provides examples of how to use the API with PHP.

## API Setup
Before using the API with PHP, ensure you have the following installed:
- **PHP** 7.x or later
- **Composer** (for package management)

To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Navigate to the repository and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    composer install

## Authentication
To authenticate with the API, you'll need an API token. Obtain it from the platform administration section. Include the token in your HTTP requests as an authorization header:
    ```bash
    $apiToken = 'your-api-token';
    $headers = [
        'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $apiToken,
        'Content-Type' => 'application/json'
    ];

## API Endpoints
Here are some examples of common API endpoints and how to interact with them using PHP and cURL.

## Create a New vCard
To create a new vCard, send a POST request to the /vcard endpoint with the required parameters (such as the phone number):
     ```bash
    $url = 'https://api.vcard-platform.com/vcard';
    $data = json_encode(['phone_number' => '123456789']);
    
    $ch = curl_init($url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    
    $response = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
    
    echo $response;

## Make a Transaction
To make a debit transaction, send a POST request to the /vcard/transaction endpoint with the transaction details:
    ```bash
    $url = 'https://api.vcard-platform.com/vcard/transaction';
    $data = json_encode([
        'phone_number' => '123456789',
        'amount' => 50.00,
        'description' => 'Grocery shopping',
        'category' => 'Food & Beverages'
    ]);
    
    $ch = curl_init($url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    
    $response = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
    
    echo $response;
