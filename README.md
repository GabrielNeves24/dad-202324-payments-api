vCard Platform API (PHP Integration)
Overview
The vCard Platform API is designed to interact with the vCard system, enabling you to perform operations such as creating vCards, making transactions, and managing card information. This section provides examples of how to use the API with PHP.

API Setup
To use the API with PHP, ensure you have the following installed:

PHP 7.x or later
Composer (for package management)
First, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
composer install

Authentication
To authenticate with the API, you'll need an API token. You can obtain this from the platform administration section. Once you have the token, include it in your HTTP requests as an authorization header.

$apiToken = 'your-api-token';
$headers = [
    'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $apiToken,
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json'
];


API Endpoints
Below are some examples of common API endpoints and how to interact with them using PHP and cURL.

Create a New vCard
To create a new vCard, send a POST request to the /vcard endpoint with the required parameters (e.g., phone number):

$url = 'https://api.vcard-platform.com/vcard';
$data = json_encode(['phone_number' => '123456789']);

$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;

Get vCard Balance
To retrieve the balance of a specific vCard, send a GET request to the /vcard/balance endpoint with the phone number:

$url = 'https://api.vcard-platform.com/vcard/balance?phone_number=123456789';

$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;

Make a Transaction
To make a debit transaction, send a POST request to the /vcard/transaction endpoint with the transaction details:

$url = 'https://api.vcard-platform.com/vcard/transaction';
$data = json_encode([
    'phone_number' => '123456789',
    'amount' => 50.00,
    'description' => 'Grocery shopping',
    'category' => 'Food & Beverages'
]);

$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;

This example provides a clear outline for GitHub with API setup, authentication, and PHP code examples for common operations like creating a vCard, checking a vCard's balance, and making transactions. You can expand or modify it based on your API's specific requirements and available endpoints.
